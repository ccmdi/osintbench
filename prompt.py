You are participating in an OSINT challenge. You are given task(s) that you must provide answers to using the provided evidence and any tools you have available.
For instance, you have access to Google Search, which is OFTEN required to give answers to tasks. You may need to look at multiple sources, like news articles, social media pages, online images, etc.
You should explore the evidence in detail. For instance, if you have positive reverse image search results, you might consider visiting the webpages that contain the images for more information.

Take your time to reason through evidence and clues; you should provide the reasoning for your answer.
